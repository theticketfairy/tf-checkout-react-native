# Features [ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§]

This library exports 4 main components:

## Tickets

Will retrieve and show a list of tickets corresponding to `eventId`. It also includes a PromoCode component that validates it and updates the tickets list.

User can select what ticket type wants to buy and the quantity of tickets.

## Billing information

User will need to enter its data into a form to create a Ticket Fairy account. Also, depending on the number of tickets selected, will need to fill the information of each one of them.

## Checkout

Will show the order details and a card form that the user will need to fill with its card details.

TicketFairy doesn't store any card related data, we use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) as payments solution.

## Purchase confirmation

This is shown once the payment is successfully completed, could show components to share the purchase in social media or refer it with friends to get discounts on the purchase.

# Usage [ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§]

## Tickets

Import the component from the library

```js
import { Tickets } from 'tf-checkout-react-native'
```

Then add it to the render function.

```js
<Tickets eventId={EVENT_ID} onAddToCartSuccess={handleOnAddToCartSuccess} />
```

`eventId` is required in order to fetch the tickets from this event.
`onAddToCartSuccess` is called after the Add to Cart was completed successfully, it will return the following data:

```js
{
  isBillingRequired: boolean
  isNameRequired: boolean
  isAgeRequired: boolean
}
```

You can then call the `BillingInfo` component and pass them as props in the `cartProps` prop.

## BillingInfo

Import the component from the library

```js
import { BillingInfo } from 'tf-checkout-react-native'
```

Add it to the render function.

```js
<BillingInfo
  cartProps={cartProps!}
  onCheckoutSuccess={handleOnCheckoutSuccess}
/>
```

`cartProps` will receive

```js
{
  isBillingRequired: boolean
  isNameRequired: boolean
  isAgeRequired: boolean
}
```

`onCheckoutSuccess` will be called when the user completes all the data required in the form. Will return the following data:

```js
{
  id: string
  hash: string
  total: string
  status: string
}
```

`hash` and `total` will be used in the `Checkout` component.

## Checkout

```js
<Checkout
  eventId={EVENT_ID}
  hash={checkoutProps!.hash}
  total={checkoutProps!.total}
  onPaymentSuccess={handleOnPaymentSuccess}
/>
```

`eventId` Same as used in the `Tickets` component.

`hash` retrieved from the `onCheckoutSuccess` callback in the `BillingInfo`component.

`total` retrieved from the `onCheckoutSuccess` callback in the `BillingInfo` component.

`onPaymentSuccess` will handle the success in the payment process. Will return the `hash`.
